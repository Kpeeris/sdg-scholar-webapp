# SDG Scholar
**SDG Scholar** is an interactive web application designed to educate users about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through educational resources and quizzes. Authorized users, such as admins, can make announcements and manage SDG-related content, providing student learning flexibility.

You can view our current deployed project at [SDG Scholar](https://sdg-scholar-webapp.vercel.app). 

### Motivation
This project was created to enhance SDG education and engage students in areas where awareness is lacking. Since many believe that SDGs only focus on sustainability, we aimed to highlight their broader scope and application. Through SDG Scholar, we hope to encourage students to actively participate in initiatives that contribute to achieving the SDGs by 2030.

### Project Status
SDG Scholar is still under development with the current version focusing on **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**. Users can explore SDG 11 target-specific content through a city-scape view. Future developments should include the other SDGs and new features (e.g. awards/badges) to improve the learning experience.

### Project Tech Stack
SDG Scholar is built with React and Vite, using Tailwind CSS for styling, Firebase for backend services, and Node.js for server-side functionality.
